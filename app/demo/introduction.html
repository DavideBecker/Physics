            // https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-build2dphysicsengine/
            // as a base, but heavily modified.

            // Some examples what the engine is capable of:

            // We can easily create new physic entities, that interact with each other
            var b1 = new Box(50, 100, 50, 50);
            var b2 = new Box(0, 200, 500, 200);
            var b3 = new Box(500, 175, 500, 200);
            var b4 = new Box(400, 100, 50, 50);

            // If an entity is static it won't be pushed back when colliding, but can push
            // other entities away. Two static objects don't interact with each other at all
            b2.isStatic = true;
            b3.isStatic = true;
            b4.isStatic = true;

            // By default the engine has a static camera at 0,0
            // You can use game.activeCamera to access its functionality
            // In this example we track the controllable box and set an offset
            game.activeCamera.track(b1);
            game.activeCamera.offset.x = -50;
            game.activeCamera.offset.y = 100;

            // We can make an entity temporarily invisible, this prevents it
            // from interacting with anything
            // b2.isVisible = false;
            // b3.isVisible = false;

            // We can use layers to render objects ontop of each other. By default every
            // element sits on layer 1000, so you can move elements to the background or in
            // front of the game scene.
            // Elements only collide with other elements that are within 100 layers of each
            // other. This allows you to have a foreground and background that have
            // completely seperate physics, or only partially interact
            b3.properties.set('layer', 1001);

            // We can change the velocity, acceleration etc anywhere we want to.
            // Either at the start to give them some initial momentum or on demand.
            // Another example below changes the velocity of an entity when keys are
            // pressed.
            b1.gravity.y = 1;
            b2.gravity.y = 0;
            b3.gravity.y = 0;

            // This shows us some graphs and stuff to visualize momentum and collisions
            // Enabling this overwrites most colors, strokes etc you set
            game.showPhysics = true;

            // We can also animate stuff pretty easily. First we define how our animation
            // should look
            var anim = new Animation(function(step) {
                // step is always between 0 (start) and 1 (end) so we can use that as a
                // multiplier to animate to a specific value
                // Note that this isn't a phyics entity, so it won't interact with them
                // Although it could
                rect(100 * step, 100 * step, 100, 100);
            }, 2000);

            // anim.isRunning = true;
