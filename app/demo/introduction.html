            // as a base, but heavily modified.

            // Some examples what the engine is capable of:

            // We can easily create new physic entities, that interact with each other
            var b1 = new Box(150, 200, 50, 50);
            var b2 = new Box(550, 50, 300, 300);
            var b3 = new Box(350, 175, 50, 50);

            // If an entity is static it won't be pushed back when colliding, but can push
            // other entities away. Two static objects don't interact with each other at all
            b2.isStatic = true;
            b3.isStatic = true;

            // By default the engine has a static camera at 0,0
            // You can use game.activeCamera to access its functionality
            // In this example we track the controllable box and set an offset,
            // so it's not stuck at the very edge of the screen
            game.activeCamera.track(b1);
            game.activeCamera.offset.x = -200;
            //game.activeCamera.offset.y = 100;
            // The camera only moves with the x axis by default, so you don't need
            // to change anything for side-scrollers or jump 'n' runs
            // but you can set which axis it should track by setting
            // game.activeCamera.scrollX or game.activeCamera.scrollY
            // to true or false

            // By default everything but the UI moves with the camera, but you
            // can change that individually for every entity, tile or
            // ui element
            b3.properties.set('fixed', true);

            // We can make an entity temporarily invisible, this prevents it
            // from interacting with anything
            // b2.isVisible = false;
            // b3.isVisible = false;

            // We can use layers to render objects ontop of each other. By default every
            // element sits on layer 1000, so you can move elements to the background or in
            // front of the game scene.
            // Elements only collide with other elements that are within 100 layers of each
            // other. This allows you to have a foreground and background that have
            // completely seperate physics, or only partially interact
            b3.properties.set('layer', 1001);

            // We can change the velocity, acceleration etc anywhere we want to.
            // Either at the start to give them some initial momentum or on demand.
            // Another example below changes the velocity of an entity when keys are
            // pressed.
